# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
MNIST digit recognition machine learning model built entirely without machine learning libraries.

Because of the size of the training and testing files, the train and test datasets must be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) and placed into the project directory.
