# MNIST-Neural-Network-Framework
MNIST digit recognition machine learning model built entirely without machine learning libraries. The purpose of this project is to build a machine-learning framework from libraries like numpy and pandas. Because of the size of the training and testing files, the train and test datasets must be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) and placed into the project directory.
